# CocktailFinder
PWA application which allows find particular cocktail

This application is made for educational use. For creating this one I learned : 
 - async/await during fetching data
 - create 'favorites' section using local storage
 - how to create manifest and service worker for this app to convert it into PWA 

I used external database created by Kodi : https://www.thecocktaildb.com/ . 

Also I want to present article written by Maciej Caputa about tips in PWA for iOS: https://www.netguru.co/codestories/few-tips-that-will-make-your-pwa-on-ios-feel-like-native , which helped me a lot.
